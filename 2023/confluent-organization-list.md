If you've been running Confluent CLI commands against a cluster in the Cloud and you 
need to verify which organization you've been running them under, you can use this command:

```
‚ùØ confluent organization list
  Current |                  ID                  |   Name     
----------+--------------------------------------+------------
  *       | 6e0269cd71b4b4cc5fd382387eef43f88691d | My_Org 
```

and your needed info will surface!
